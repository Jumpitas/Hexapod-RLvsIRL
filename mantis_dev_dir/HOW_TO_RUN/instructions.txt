Tutorial: 

1- Install python 3.9 in your computer

2- Set your interpreter to use python 3.9

3- Create your virtual environment by using your version of: 
   "/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python"

4- Install requirements on your virtual environment/venv:
   "pip install -r requirements.txt"

5- Run `train.py`, answer the input questions and enjoy!



Disclaimers:

 - Should be compatible with both Linux and Windows, but all of training and testing was carried out in Windows. Simply change line 51 in the `heaxpod_env.py`, modifying 'webots_cmd' to:
   "webots_cmd = os.environ.get("WEBOTS_CMD", "webots")"

 - Webots must be closed whenever you attempt to run train.py, as it will count as an instance of a socket and crash the initialization process.

 - DO NOT SAVE the Webots world whenever you finish training, as the reset function simply restarts the world. In case you accidentally overwrite the predefined initial position, there are instructions in the mantis.py file on how to set it up, as per empirically defined.

 - You can stop training at any time. Interruptions will result in graceful stops, creating logs and saving the model with no overwrites.
