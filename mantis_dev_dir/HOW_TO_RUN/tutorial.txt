1- Install python 3.9 in your computer

2- Set your interpreter to use python 3.9

3- Create your virtual environment by using your version of: 

 "/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python"

4- Install requirements on your virtual environment/venv:

 "pip install -r requirements.txt"

5- Run `train.py`, answer the input questions and enjoy!


Disclaimers:

 - Webots must be closed whenever you attempt to run train.py, as it will count as na instance of a socket and crash the initialization process.

 - DO NOT SAVE the Webots world whenever you finish training, as the reset function simply restarts the world.In case you accidentally overwrite the predefined initial position, there are instructions in the mantis.py file on how to set it up as per empirically defined.

 - You can stop training at any time. Interrumptions will result in graceful stops, creating logs and saving the model with no overwrites.
